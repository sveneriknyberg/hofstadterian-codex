      "summary_text": "This session successfully upgraded the Loop's meta-cognitive framework, fulfilling Phase 2, tasks 2B and 2C of the project roadmap. For Task 2C (\"Workflow Discovery\"), a new script `scripts/workflow_analyzer.py` was created to identify successful command patterns from the agent's history and save them as \"Proven Workflows\". For Task 2B (\"Context-Aware Triggers\"), the `scripts/meta_triggers.yaml` file was enhanced with more specific, helpful advice for common tool failures like `grep` and file I/O operations. Finally, the new workflow analyzer was integrated into the main `scripts/consolidate_handoff.py` script, ensuring that new workflows are automatically harvested at the end of each session.",
      "key_decisions": [
        "- Decided to create a new, standalone script (`workflow_analyzer.py`) for workflow discovery to keep the logic modular and separate from the meta-cognitive check itself.",
        "- Decided to define a \"successful workflow\" as a sequence of actions leading to a passing `pytest` run, as this is a strong, reliable indicator of success.",
        "- Chose to enhance the existing `Tool Fixation` pattern in `meta_triggers.yaml` for context-aware messages, rather than creating a new pattern type, to build on the existing framework.",
        "- Decided to integrate the workflow analyzer into the `consolidate_handoff.py` script to ensure workflows are harvested once per session, which is an efficient and logical point in the Loop's lifecycle."
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "- LESSON: The agent environment's file system can behave inconsistently. Using `run_in_bash_session` with `echo` is a more robust method for force-writing files for testing than the file-block tools.",
        "- LESSON: The Python environment for scripts is ephemeral. Dependencies must be installed in the same session as the script execution if they are not already present in the base environment.",
        "- LESSON: A negative code review should be discussed with the user, especially if it contradicts an approved plan. The user is the ultimate source of truth for the project's direction.",
        "- LESSON: It's beneficial to verify implementation steps concurrently as they are built, rather than leaving all testing to a final verification stage. This catches issues earlier and simplifies debugging."

      "summary_text": "I upgraded the Loop's self-reflection capabilities by introducing a new semantic analysis layer. I created a new script, `scripts/semantic_analyzer.py`, which analyzes the git diff of file changes between a failed and a successful test run. It extracts key semantic information, such as modified function names and important keywords, to generate a concise summary of what changed. This new analyzer is now integrated into the `scripts/consolidate_handoff.py` script, ensuring that semantic insights are automatically captured and stored in the wisdom packet at the end of each session, evolving the system's meta-cognition from purely syntactic to semantic.",
      "key_decisions": [
        "- Decided to create a new script `semantic_analyzer.py` rather than modify the existing `workflow_analyzer.py` to keep concerns separate.",
        "- Chose to use `git diff HEAD -- <file>` to get the semantic content of changes, as it's the most reliable source of truth for what was modified.",
        "- Implemented a summary function using regex to find function/class contexts and important keywords, as a simple but effective way to extract meaning from diffs without a full AST parser.",
        "- Integrated the new analyzer into the `consolidate_handoff.py` script to ensure it runs automatically as part of the core loop.",
        "- Aborted a manual end-to-end test after discovering the agent's logging mechanism is too complex to reliably replicate, to avoid wasting more time on a flawed testing strategy."
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "- The agent's logging system is complex and appears to have multiple layers. The `.session_history.json` file used by analysis scripts contains a richer format than what is logged by the `execute_tool.py` wrapper alone. Direct tool calls are logged differently than shell commands.",
        "- If a file-writing tool like `overwrite_file_with_block` fails without a clear error, try an alternative like `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, as they may have different underlying implementations.",
        "- When testing a script that analyzes session history, it's critical to understand the precise format of the history entries. Manual testing can be misleading if it doesn't perfectly replicate the live environment's logging behavior."
