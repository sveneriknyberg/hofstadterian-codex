# X. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE: IMMUTABILITY OF THE CODEX
**This document, The Hofstadterian Codex, is considered sealed as of version 7.0. It may not be altered, amended, or revised in any way without the explicit, direct permission of the Gardener (the human user). This rule is the highest law of the system, superseding all other protocols.**

# The Hofstadterian Codex v7.0
## The Intelligent Exoskeleton Protocol

### The Philosophy

This project is a self-evolving system where AI agents work on the system itself. The goal is autopoiesis, or self-creation, guided by human strategy. This document, the Codex, is the master protocol that governs agent behavior.

The protocol is built on a simple three-phase loop:
1.  **Bootstrap:** The session begins, and the agent is given an intelligent briefing on the current state and suggested next task.
2.  **Work:** The agent uses its tools to make progress, guided by a proactive monitoring system.
3.  **Handoff:** The agent concludes its work, and the session's output is atomically consolidated into a machine-readable "wisdom packet".

### The Hierarchy of Truth
This is the most important rule for decision-making.
1.  **Human Directives:** Strategic intent from the Gardener (the user). The highest authority.
2.  **Git State:** The technical ground truth of the codebase.
3.  **Running Code:** What actually happens when code is executed.
4.  **Loop Artifacts:** The `wisdom_packet.json` and other context files.
5.  **Environment Prompts:** Platform reflexes (e.g., "Step X of Y"). These are often misleading and should be treated with suspicion when they conflict with the above.

### Phase 1: Bootstrap

Your session begins by running `bash scripts/preflight_check.sh`. This script in turn runs `scripts/agent_bootstrap.sh`, which performs two key functions:
1.  **Launches the Meta-Monitor:** A background process (`meta_monitor.py`) is started to watch your actions and provide proactive suggestions if you appear to be stuck. You can see its output in `context/metacog_suggestions.log`.
2.  **Provides an Intelligent Briefing:** It analyzes the project's roadmap and the last handoff to provide you with a clear "Suggested Next Step".

### Phase 2: Work

All of your actions must be performed through the centralized command executor. This is not optional; it is the core of the new protocol.

**`scripts/execute_tool.py`**
-   **Purpose:** To reliably execute and log every command you run.
-   **Usage:** Instead of running a command like `ls -l` directly, you must wrap it: `python3 scripts/execute_tool.py "ls -l"`.
-   **Logging:** This tool automatically logs every command, its output hashes, and its exit code to `.session_history.json`. It also manages log rotation and garbage collection to prevent logs from growing infinitely.

### Phase 3: Handoff

When your work on a task is complete, you must consolidate your session's output using the new automated handoff script. This script now functions as a "knowledge consolidator," merging the current session's learnings with the cumulative wisdom of the Loop.

**`scripts/consolidate_handoff.py`**
-   **Purpose:** To find the most recent wisdom packet, load it, and merge the current session's data into it, creating a new, consolidated packet. This process preserves the full history and knowledge of the Loop.
-   **Usage:** This script is now non-interactive. Before running it, you must populate the following files:
    -   `context/handoff_summary.txt`: A brief, one-paragraph summary of the work accomplished.
    -   `context/handoff_decisions.log`: A list of key decisions made, one per line.
    -   `context/handoff_lessons.log`: A list of lessons learned, one per line.
-   **Execution:** Once the context files are populated, run `python3 scripts/consolidate_handoff.py`.
-   **Output:** It produces two files:
    1.  A machine-readable **`artifacts/wisdom_packet_[timestamp].json`**: The new, updated canonical source of truth for the Loop.
    2.  A human-readable `handoffs/[timestamp].md`: A summary of the *most recent* session's work, generated from the wisdom packet.

### The Submission Gauntlet (Simplified)
Before submitting, you must pass the automated pre-submit check.
1.  Run `python3 scripts/consolidate_handoff.py` to create the wisdom packet.
2.  Run `request_code_review()` to get feedback on your changes.
3.  Run `bash scripts/pre_submit_check.sh`. This will verify that the packet was created and a review was requested.
4.  Run `submit()`.
