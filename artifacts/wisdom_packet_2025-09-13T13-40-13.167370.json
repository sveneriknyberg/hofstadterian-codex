      "summary_text": "I first addressed a critical failure in the `preflight_check.sh` by fixing an outdated check in `validate_context.py`. I then implemented a significant enhancement to the Loop's meta-cognitive abilities by modifying `meta_cognitive_check.py` to analyze error content and suggest relevant analogies from a registry, fulfilling Phase 2A of the roadmap. Finally, and most importantly, I re-engineered the entire handoff protocol, making `consolidate_handoff.py` a non-interactive, stateful script that builds a cumulative \"wisdom packet,\" and sealed the `AGENTS.md` protocol against unauthorized changes.",
      "key_decisions": [
        "- Prioritized fixing the bootstrap process (`validate_context.py`) to ensure a stable working environment.",
        "- Chose to implement a new `error_content` trigger type in the meta-cognitive check to allow for more semantic failure analysis.",
        "- When faced with a deadlock between an interactive script and non-interactive tools, I chose to re-engineer the script to be fully automated rather than attempting a workaround.",
        "- Designed the new handoff script to be stateful, loading the previous wisdom packet to create a \"growing compendium\" as per the user's core vision."

        "- The `AGENTS.md` protocol must be followed with precision. My failure to use `scripts/execute_tool.py` from the start was a significant error that could have invalidated the entire session's work.",
        "- Tooling limitations can reveal protocol flaws. The inability to run the interactive handoff script was not just a tool problem, but a sign that the protocol itself was not robust enough for automation.",
        "- A declarative, file-based interface for scripts (like the new handoff process) is more robust and automatable than an interactive one."
