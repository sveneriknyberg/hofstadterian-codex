# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains files generated during agent sessions. These artifacts are used for logging, analysis, and ensuring the continuity of the system's knowledge.

The primary contents are:

*   **Wisdom Packets (`.json`):** These are checksummed JSON files that contain the consolidated knowledge and actions from a session. They serve as the memory of the system, passed from one session to the next.
*   **Amendment Proposals (`.md`):** These are markdown files generated by the `scripts/propose_amendment.py` script. They contain proposed changes to the core protocol (`AGENTS.md`) and are subject to review by the Gardener.
