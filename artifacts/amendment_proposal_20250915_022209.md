- 2.  **Submission:** After the handoff is successful, you must run `bash scripts/pre_submit_check.sh`. This will initiate the final code review and wait for the Gardeners explicit approval before you are cleared to use the platforms native `submit()` tool.

```

## 2. Rationale

This amendment corrects two minor grammatical errors (missing apostrophes in 'Gardener's' and 'platform's') in the 'Session Lifecycle' section of the AGENTS.md file. Correcting these typos improves the clarity, professionalism, and overall quality of the core protocol document.

## 3. Impact Analysis

This is a low-risk, cosmetic change with no impact on the functional logic of the protocol. The change only affects a comment in the documentation, making it safer. The risk of unintended side-effects is negligible.
