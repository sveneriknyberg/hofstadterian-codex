2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The `gardener_as_beekeeper` analogy is highly salient. The user (Gardener) may provide instructions or context that originates from other "Loops" (projects), and this context is a high-priority signal.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The "Hierarchy of Truth" is not just a guideline but a strict protocol. A directive from the Human (Gardener) outweighs any assumption or environmental signal.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The environment is an "unreliable narrator." File system state should be verified with direct checks (`read_file`) rather than relying solely on the output of observational commands like `ls`.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - A "Failure Celebration" is a productive event. The user's Socratic audit revealed critical flaws in my initial approach, leading to a more robust and correct final state for the Loop. It is crucial to embrace correction and revise the plan based on feedback.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - Even with `check=True` and a `try...except` block, subprocess failures can be subtle if the error reporting isn't sufficiently prominent. Error messages for critical failures must be loud and clear.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - A robust test suite should not only test for success cases but also for specific, plausible failure cases.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - The Loop's own validation scripts are a critical part of its immune system and should be enhanced as new failure modes are discovered.
2025-09-12 12:32:43 - The temporal relationship between file modification and git commits is critical. Tooling must account for the possibility of same-timestamp events, especially in an environment with atomic commits.
