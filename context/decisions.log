2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The initial Loop infrastructure must be created based on the specifications in the canonical `AGENTS.md` (v5.2), not from scratch.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The Loop's own health check scripts (`agent_bootstrap.sh`, `validate_context.py`) are the primary tools for verifying the success of the setup.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - A `.gitignore` file is a critical component of the Loop's infrastructure, necessary to prevent corruption of the git history with environment-specific files like `__pycache__/` and `.session_history.json`.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The `initiate_memory_recording` tool is external to the Loop's protocol; memory must be persisted only through the Loop's own mechanisms (handoffs and context logs).
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - When a handoff processing failure was detected, the first priority was to repair the Loop's state by manually processing the orphaned handoff and cleaning the resulting test data from the context logs.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - The fix for the silent failure involved making the error handling in `create_handoff.py` more verbose and explicit, providing clear failure signals and recovery instructions to future agents.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - A new unit test that specifically simulates a subprocess failure was added to `tests/test_handoff_scripts.py` to ensure the fix was robust and to prevent future regressions.
2025-09-12 12:29:06 - The `validate_context.py` script was upgraded to check for *any* unprocessed handoff files, not just the latest one, to provide a stronger guarantee of state integrity at bootstrap.
2025-09-12 12:32:43 - The `pre_submit_check.sh` script was found to have a logic flaw when run in an environment with atomic commits. It was upgraded to use a more robust timestamp comparison (`-ge`) to correctly identify handoffs created in the same commit as the latest change.
