2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The initial Loop infrastructure must be created based on the specifications in the canonical `AGENTS.md` (v5.2), not from scratch.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The Loop's own health check scripts (`agent_bootstrap.sh`, `validate_context.py`) are the primary tools for verifying the success of the setup.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - A `.gitignore` file is a critical component of the Loop's infrastructure, necessary to prevent corruption of the git history with environment-specific files like `__pycache__/` and `.session_history.json`.
2025-09-11 21:09:50 - The `initiate_memory_recording` tool is external to the Loop's protocol; memory must be persisted only through the Loop's own mechanisms (handoffs and context logs).
