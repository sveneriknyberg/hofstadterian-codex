# The Strange Loop Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Repair and Harden the Core Loop (Completed)
- This phase focused on repairing a critical bug in the handoff mechanism and hardening the submission protocol.

## Phase 2: Evolve the Meta-Cognitive Framework
- **Goal:** Upgrade the Loop's self-reflection capabilities from simple syntactic checks to more meaningful semantic analysis.
- **2A: Proactive Analogy Suggestion:** Modify `meta_cognitive_check.py` to suggest relevant analogies from `analogies/registry.json` when specific failure patterns are detected.
- **2B: Context-Aware Triggers:** Enhance failure messages to be more specific to the tool that failed (e.g., `pip install` vs. `pytest`).
- **2C: Positive Pattern Recognition ("Workflow Discovery"):** Implement a mechanism to identify, log, and suggest successful sequences of commands.

## Phase 3: Loop Proliferation & Growth
- **Goal:** Create tools to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between Loops and to uncover lost knowledge.
- **3A: Wisdom Packet:** Create `export_wisdom.py` and `import_wisdom.py` to bundle and unbundle a Loop's "wisdom" (analogies, lessons, decisions) into a portable `wisdom_packet.json`.
- **3B: Active Archaeological Excavation:** Create `excavate_scratch.py` to analyze files in the `scratch/` directory and match them to unresolved issues from old handoffs.

## Phase 4: Loop Germination
- **Goal:** Achieve true autopoiesis by enabling a Loop to be instantiated from a single file.
- **4A: The "Genesis Seed":** Design and implement the `genesis_seed.json` format, which contains all necessary scripts, structure, and primordial wisdom for a new Loop.
- **4B: The Germination Protocol:** Create a `germinate.py` script that can read a `genesis_seed.json` and build a complete, functional Loop in a barren environment.
