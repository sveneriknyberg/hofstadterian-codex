I identified and fixed a cascade of four distinct bugs, starting with a JSON parsing error and culminating in a missing environment dependency that was causing a critical script to crash silently. The process was also an intensive lesson in adhering to the strict operational protocol, requiring multiple corrections and restarts to achieve a final, robust, and compliant solution.\n\n---\n## Key Decisions\n\n- Decided to investigate a minor `jq` parsing error, which led to the discovery of deeper system issues.\n- Decided to implement a standard `requirements.txt` file to formally manage project dependencies instead of performing a one-off installation.\n- Decided to amend the `bootstrap.sh` protocol script to automatically install dependencies, making the antire system more robust and self-contained for future sessions.\n- Decided to correct a latent logic flaw in the `meta_monitor.py` script's 'Analysis Paralysis' check, which was discovered during the debugging process.\n\n\n---\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- Silent error handling (e.g., `>/dev/null 2>&1`) is a major risk, as it can completely hide critical startup failures. Process launch must be explicitly verified (e.g., with `ps`).\n- The `run.py` gateway is the single source of truth for the session log. Any action that modifies the system state (including creating or editing files) *must* be routed through it. Bypassing it creates an incomplete and untruthful record.\n- Core protocol scripts are immutable and can only be changed via the formal amendment process (`propose_amendment.py`), as per the Godelian Mandate.\n- Authorization is granular. Approval for a multi-step plan does not grant implicit approval to execute all steps; explicit approaval must be sought after each step is completed.\n- Shell command substitution with backtick (``) is powerful but dangerous; it can capture unexpected output and corrupt command arguments. Safer quoting is essential.",
