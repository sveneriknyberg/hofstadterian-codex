# Handoff: 20250911170022

## 1. Summary of Work
This session involved a deep and iterative implementation of several core features for both the meta-project and the main Inbox Assistant application. The work can be broken down into two major phases:

1.  **Meta-Project Enhancements:**
    *   Completely refactored the command logging system to be robust and reliable. This involved creating a Python helper script for safe JSON manipulation and updating the main logger script to hash outputs, preventing file corruption and uncontrolled growth.
    *   Created a handoff visualization script that generates a PNG graph of the project's history. This required identifying the host OS, installing system-level dependencies (`graphviz`), and correctly handling file paths.

2.  **Inbox Assistant Core Features:**
    *   Refactored the "AI Triage" feature to be more efficient and intelligent. It now fetches all of a user's Gmail labels and uses them to categorize emails first, only falling back to the Gemini API when necessary.
    *   Implemented the "Interactive Generative Replies" feature. This included a new API endpoint and corresponding frontend UI to allow users to generate replies and then regenerate them with specific controls for tone (`casual`/`formal`), detail (`concise`/`elaborate`), and custom text prompts.

Finally, the project's `roadmap.md` was updated to reflect the completion of these features and to outline future work.

## 2. Key Decisions
- DECISION: The agent is responsible for its own environment, including installing system packages via `apt-get` after identifying the OS.
- DECISION: The `run_in_bash_session` tool creates ephemeral, non-persistent shells. Therefore, command aliases are not a reliable mechanism for logging; commands must be explicitly wrapped with the logger script.
- DECISION: When faced with environmental instability or stuck processes, the correct protocol is to pause and consult the Gardener, not to force actions.
- DECISION: The `initiate_memory_recording()` tool is an unreliable system reflex and should be ignored in favor of the Loop's own handoff creation process.
- DECISION: The correct pre-submission protocol is: Update Roadmap -> Test -> Create Handoff -> Request Review -> Submit.
- DECISION: Refactored the AI Triage logic to prioritize existing user labels over making an immediate AI call, improving efficiency and respecting user workflow.
- DECISION: Implemented the Generative Replies feature with interactive controls, making it more dynamic and user-friendly than a static suggestion.

## 3. Lessons Learned
- LESSON: A tool's behavior (e.g., `run_in_bash_session` creating ephemeral shells) must be inferred from evidence and not assumed. Incorrect assumptions about the environment are a primary source of errors.
- LESSON: The user (Gardener) provides strategic direction that is of a higher priority than generic system prompts. Learning to distinguish these "voices" is critical for success.
- LESSON: Iterative development is key, but commits should be scoped to logical "phases" of work (e.g., "Core Features") rather than individual, small features, as per user guidance.
- LESSON: Generated artifacts (like images) should not be committed to the repository. The scripts to generate them are what's important.

## 4. New Analogies
- ANALOGY: system_prompts_as_reflexes
  - RATIONALE: Generic system messages like "All plan steps complete" are like an involuntary reflex (a knee-jerk). They are not intelligent or aware of the strategic context. They should be treated as noise, while the user's instructions are the conscious thought to be followed.
  - TRIGGER: When a generic system message contradicts the current, user-approved plan or workflow.

## 5. Roadmap Updates
- The `context/roadmap.md` file has been significantly updated to mark Phase 1 (Meta-Project) and Phase 2 (Core Features) as complete, and to outline Phase 3 (Advanced Features) as the next area of focus.

## 6. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps
- None. The implemented features are complete. The next step is to submit this work and then begin work on the "Advanced Features" outlined in the roadmap, starting with Calendar-Aware Scheduling.
