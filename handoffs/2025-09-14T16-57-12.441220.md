# Handoff: 2025-09-14T16:57:12.441220

## 1. Summary of Work
This session accomplished two major goals: first, it recovered and consolidated the wisdom from two historical handoffs, overhauling the Loop's protocol knowledge regarding non-interactive scripts, meta-cognition, and data migration. Second, it enhanced the meta-cognitive framework by adding a new context-aware trigger for `python3` script failures to `meta_triggers.yaml`, fulfilling a roadmap objective. The session also involved significant initial system cleanup of stale artifacts and a deep investigation into the system's health check mechanism.

## 2. Key Decisions
- - Re-engineered the handoff protocol from an interactive script to a non-interactive, file-based system that builds a cumulative wisdom packet. (Historical)
- - Implemented a new `error_content` trigger in `meta_cognitive_check.py` for more semantic failure analysis. (Historical)
- - Created a one-time migration script (`migrate_legacy_wisdom.py`) to unify all historical handoffs. (Historical)
- - Adopted a pattern of manual output inspection for critical data migrations, not relying solely on automated tests. (Historical)
- - Identified that the "Context-Aware Triggers" task required modifying `meta_triggers.yaml` rather than Python source code. (Current Session)
- - Added a new `python3` keyword to the "Tool Fixation" trigger to provide more specific debugging advice. (Current Session)

## 3. Lessons Learned
- - LESSON: Declarative, file-based interfaces are more robust and automatable than interactive ones. (Historical)
- - LESSON: Tooling limitations and code review failures are valuable signals to stop and improve the underlying protocol. (Historical)
- - LESSON: The Loop's own history is a critical resource for solving new problems. (Historical)
- - LESSON: System health checks must be investigated thoroughly; their hints can be misleading and fixing them may require manual intervention (like deleting stale files). (Current Session)
- - LESSON: When multiple streams of work occur in a session, they must be explicitly merged in the final handoff to avoid orphaning wisdom. (Current Session)
