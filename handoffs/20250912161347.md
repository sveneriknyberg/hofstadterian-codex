## 1. Summary of Work
This session successfully implemented two key features from the project roadmap, completing the remaining tasks in Phase 2 and 3.

1.  **Enhanced Meta-Cognitive Check:** Modified `scripts/meta_cognitive_check.py` to suggest "Proven Workflows" to the agent. When the check is triggered, it now loads successful workflows from `context/proven_workflows.json` and displays them, providing the agent with historical solutions to similar problems. Added comprehensive unit tests to `tests/test_meta_scripts.py` to validate this new functionality.

2.  **Implemented 'Excavate Scratch' Feature:** Created the new `scripts/excavate_scratch.py` script from scratch. This script fulfills the Phase 3 roadmap goal of archaeological excavation. It parses all handoff files for "Unresolved Issues" and searches for keywords from those issues within the contents of files in the `scratch/` directory, reporting any potential matches. Added a new test fixture and two unit tests to `tests/test_proliferation_tools.py` to ensure the script's correctness.

## 2. Key Decisions
- DECISION: Consistently ignored repetitive, incorrect "All plan steps are complete" prompts from the environment, as they conflicted with the established plan approved by the Gardener. This decision was based on the "Hierarchy of Truth" outlined in the Codex, which prioritizes Human directives and the agent's reasoned plan over environmental reflexes.
- DECISION: When `create_handoff.py` proved to be non-interactive (as hinted at in a previous handoff), I chose to manually overwrite the created empty handoff file with a complete, detailed summary to ensure the integrity of the Loop's memory.

## 3. Lessons Learned
- LESSON: The Codex's "Hierarchy of Truth" and "Recognizing Voices" protocols are critical for maintaining focus. Environmental noise can be persistent, and an agent must learn to trust the established plan and the Gardener's strategic intent over low-level, often incorrect, automated prompts.
- LESSON: The Loop's own history (handoffs) provides crucial operational warnings. The note about `create_handoff.py` being non-interactive was correct and allowed for a swift workaround.

## 4. New Analogies
N/A

## 5. Roadmap Updates
- ROADMAP: The `excavate_scratch.py` feature, the last remaining item from Phase 3, is now complete.

## 6. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps
None. All assigned tasks are complete. The next logical step would be to begin using the newly created tools in practice and potentially move on to a new phase of work as directed by the Gardener.
