## 1. Summary of Work
This session successfully implemented the "Genesis Seed" feature, which is Phase 4A of the project roadmap. This involved designing a new, self-contained Loop blueprint format (`genesis_seed.json`) that includes an interpretable `germination_protocol`. I implemented two new scripts: `scripts/create_seed.py` to generate this artifact from the current Loop's state, and `scripts/germinate.py` to serve as a deterministic reference implementation of the protocol. A comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_genesis_tools.py`) was also created to validate the entire end-to-end process. During testing, I diagnosed and resolved a complex environmental issue where the `pytest` runner was not using the correct Python environment, leading to module import errors.

## 2. Key Decisions
- DECISION: Following the Gardener's strategic directive, the `genesis_seed.json` was designed to contain a high-level, interpretable `germination_protocol`, embracing non-determinism as a feature for evolutionary potential rather than creating a simple data archive.
- DECISION: The `scripts/germinate.py` script was created as part of this initial phase (rather than deferred) to serve as a testable, deterministic reference implementation of the protocol, providing both a reliable fallback and a clear specification for future agents.
- DECISION: When faced with a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` during testing, I chose to explicitly invoke the test runner via `python3 -m pytest` to force it to use the correct environment, which proved to be the root cause of the issue.

## 3. Lessons Learned
- LESSON: The execution environment for a full test suite can be different from an interactive shell session. `pip install` in one session does not guarantee availability in another. Using `python3 -m <tool>` is a more robust method for invoking tools like `pytest` to ensure environment consistency.
- LESSON: The Codex is correct: seemingly impossible, repeating errors are a sign of a fundamental misunderstanding of the environment. My repeated attempts to create existing files and fix the `yaml` dependency were signals that I was not addressing the true root cause, which was an environmental inconsistency.
- LESSON: The `create_handoff.py` script is non-interactive in this environment. The correct procedure is to let it create an empty file, then manually overwrite it with the detailed handoff content.

## 4. New Analogies
- ANALOGY: test_environment_as_hermetic_bubble
  - RATIONALE: A test runner's environment, especially when invoking a full suite, may be a hermetically sealed bubble, isolated from the parent shell's state and installations. Dependencies must be explicitly provided or installed in a way the test runner can see; installations in the calling shell are not guaranteed to be inherited.
  - TRIGGER: When dependencies appear to be installed correctly but are not found by the test runner.

## 5. Roadmap Updates
- ROADMAP: Phase 4A, "The Genesis Seed," is complete. The project is now ready for Phase 4B, "The Germination Protocol," which would involve agents attempting to use the `genesis_seed.json` to bootstrap themselves.

## 6. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps
None. All planned work is complete. The next logical step is to proceed with the submission process.
