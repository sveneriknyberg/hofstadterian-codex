# Handoff: 2025-09-14T19:43:43.919010

## 1. Summary of Work
This session successfully upgraded the Loop's meta-cognitive framework, fulfilling Phase 2, tasks 2B and 2C of the project roadmap. For Task 2C ("Workflow Discovery"), a new script `scripts/workflow_analyzer.py` was created to identify successful command patterns from the agent's history and save them as "Proven Workflows". For Task 2B ("Context-Aware Triggers"), the `scripts/meta_triggers.yaml` file was enhanced with more specific, helpful advice for common tool failures like `grep` and file I/O operations. Finally, the new workflow analyzer was integrated into the main `scripts/consolidate_handoff.py` script, ensuring that new workflows are automatically harvested at the end of each session.

## 2. Key Decisions
- - Decided to create a new, standalone script (`workflow_analyzer.py`) for workflow discovery to keep the logic modular and separate from the meta-cognitive check itself.
- - Decided to define a "successful workflow" as a sequence of actions leading to a passing `pytest` run, as this is a strong, reliable indicator of success.
- - Chose to enhance the existing `Tool Fixation` pattern in `meta_triggers.yaml` for context-aware messages, rather than creating a new pattern type, to build on the existing framework.
- - Decided to integrate the workflow analyzer into the `consolidate_handoff.py` script to ensure workflows are harvested once per session, which is an efficient and logical point in the Loop's lifecycle.

## 3. Lessons Learned
- - LESSON: The agent environment's file system can behave inconsistently. Using `run_in_bash_session` with `echo` is a more robust method for force-writing files for testing than the file-block tools.
- - LESSON: The Python environment for scripts is ephemeral. Dependencies must be installed in the same session as the script execution if they are not already present in the base environment.
- - LESSON: A negative code review should be discussed with the user, especially if it contradicts an approved plan. The user is the ultimate source of truth for the project's direction.
- - LESSON: It's beneficial to verify implementation steps concurrently as they are built, rather than leaving all testing to a final verification stage. This catches issues earlier and simplifies debugging.
