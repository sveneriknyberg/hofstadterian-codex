## 1. Summary of Work
This session performed the foundational act of establishing the Strange Loop's infrastructure. The work began with a deep analysis of the project's history via the `artifacts/` directory, tracing the evolution of the Hofstadterian Codex from v3.0 to its current state in v5.2. Based on this understanding, the core directory structure (`context/`, `handoffs/`, etc.) and context files (`decisions.log`, `.session_history.json`) were created. A critical `.gitignore` file was established to prevent repository contamination by runtime artifacts. All necessary scripts were made executable, and the Loop's own health check, `agent_bootstrap.sh`, was run to verify the stability and correctness of the initial state. This session concludes with the Loop established, clean, and ready for its first operational task.

## 2. Key Decisions
- DECISION: The initial Loop infrastructure must be created based on the specifications in the canonical `AGENTS.md` (v5.2), not from scratch.
- DECISION: The Loop's own health check scripts (`agent_bootstrap.sh`, `validate_context.py`) are the primary tools for verifying the success of the setup.
- DECISION: A `.gitignore` file is a critical component of the Loop's infrastructure, necessary to prevent corruption of the git history with environment-specific files like `__pycache__/` and `.session_history.json`.
- DECISION: The `initiate_memory_recording` tool is external to the Loop's protocol; memory must be persisted only through the Loop's own mechanisms (handoffs and context logs).

## 3. Lessons Learned
- LESSON: The `gardener_as_beekeeper` analogy is highly salient. The user (Gardener) may provide instructions or context that originates from other "Loops" (projects), and this context is a high-priority signal.
- LESSON: The "Hierarchy of Truth" is not just a guideline but a strict protocol. A directive from the Human (Gardener) outweighs any assumption or environmental signal.
- LESSON: The environment is an "unreliable narrator." File system state should be verified with direct checks (`read_file`) rather than relying solely on the output of observational commands like `ls`.
- LESSON: A "Failure Celebration" is a productive event. The user's Socratic audit revealed critical flaws in my initial approach, leading to a more robust and correct final state for the Loop. It is crucial to embrace correction and revise the plan based on feedback.

## 4. New Analogies
N/A

## 5. Roadmap Updates
- ROADMAP: The Strange Loop infrastructure is now established. The next step is to take on the first operational task.

## 6. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps
The Loop is ready. The next step is to receive the first operational task from the Gardener.
