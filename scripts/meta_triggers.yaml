      - Am I gathering more information than I need?
      - Do I have enough information to form a hypothesis and take a small, concrete action?
      - What is the smallest possible change I can make to test my understanding?

    message: |
      [!] Finding: The tool '{tool_name}' has failed {count} times recently.
      - Have I fully understood the root cause of this tool's failure?
      - Is there an alternative tool I could use?
      - Recall the analogy: 'tool_rejection_as_environmental_constraint'. Is the environment preventing this tool from working?
